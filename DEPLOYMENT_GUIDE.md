## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains how to safely promote AI agents from development to production using a **three-stage deployment process**:

```
Development → Staging → Production
    ↓            ↓           ↓
  Testing    Validation   Live Users
```

### Why Three Stages?

| Stage | Purpose | Risk Level | Speed |
|-------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Dev** | Rapid iteration, experimentation | High (expected failures) | Fast |
| **Staging** | Final validation before production | Medium (should be stable) | Moderate |
| **Production** | Serve real users | Low (must be stable) | Slow (careful rollout) |

---

## 🏗️ The Three Environments

### 1️⃣ Development Environment

**Purpose**: Where developers actively work and test changes

**Characteristics**:
- **Users**: Developers, QA engineers
- **Stability**: Frequently broken, rapid changes expected
- **Data**: Fake/synthetic test data
- **Agent IDs**: `AGENT_ID_BASELINE`, `AGENT_ID_V2` (for A/B testing)
- **Evaluation**: Full suite runs on every PR
- **Duration**: Minutes to hours

**When code changes**:
```bash
1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Opens PR → Triggers CI/CD evaluation
3. Quality + Safety + Red Team tests run
4. Results posted to PR for review
5. If approved → Merge to main branch
```

---

### 2️⃣ Staging Environment (Pre-production)

**Purpose**: Mirror of production for final validation

**Characteristics**:
- **Users**: QA team, Product managers, Stakeholders
- **Stability**: Should be stable, matches production configuration
- **Data**: Sanitized production data or realistic test data
- **Agent ID**: `AGENT_ID_STAGING`
- **Evaluation**: Extended test suite + manual testing
- **Duration**: 24-48 hours (soak testing)

**What happens in staging**:
```bash
1. Automated deployment from main branch
2. Smoke tests (2-5 minutes)
3. Integration tests (15-30 minutes)
4. User acceptance testing (UAT) - manual validation
5. Performance/load testing
6. Soak testing (24-48 hours monitoring)
7. Stakeholder approval gate
```

**Staging Checklist**:
- [ ] Smoke tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] UAT completed by product team
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] No errors in 48-hour soak test
- [ ] Security review completed (if needed)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off received

---

### 3️⃣ Production Environment

**Purpose**: Live system serving real users

**Characteristics**:
- **Users**: End users, customers
- **Stability**: Must be highly stable and reliable
- **Data**: Real user data (protected)
- **Agent ID**: `AGENT_ID_PRODUCTION`
- **Evaluation**: Continuous monitoring + periodic deep evaluation
- **Duration**: Gradual rollout over hours/days

**Production deployment strategies**:

#### **Option A: Blue-Green Deployment** ✅ Recommended
```
1. Current agent (Blue) serves 100% traffic
2. Deploy new agent (Green) to production (inactive)
3. Run smoke tests on Green
4. Switch 10% traffic to Green → Monitor 1 hour
5. Switch 50% traffic to Green → Monitor 2 hours
6. Switch 100% traffic to Green
7. Keep Blue warm for 24 hours (quick rollback)
```

#### **Option B: Canary Deployment**
```
1. Deploy to 5% of users → Monitor 1 hour
2. Deploy to 25% of users → Monitor 2 hours
3. Deploy to 100% of users
```

#### **Option C: Manual Approval Gate** (Safest for critical systems)
```
1. Deploy new agent (inactive)
2. Run production smoke tests
3. STOP: Require human approval
4. Manual review of all metrics
5. Human clicks "Approve" button
6. Agent activated for all users
```

## 🛡️ Safety Net Layers

### Why Multiple Testing Stages?

Each stage catches different types of issues:

| Stage | What It Catches | Example |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| **PR Evaluation** | Code quality, obvious bugs | Agent hallucinating product info |
| **Staging Smoke Tests** | Deployment issues | Wrong environment variables |
| **Staging Integration** | System integration problems | Inventory API auth failing |
| **Staging Soak** | Performance degradation | Memory leak after 1000 requests |
| **Production Canary** | Real-world edge cases | Unexpected user query patterns |
| **Production Monitor** | Production-only issues | Peak traffic performance problems |

### Cost of Finding Bugs at Each Stage

```
💰 $1      - Fix in development (PR caught it)
💰💰 $10     - Fix in staging (QA caught it)
💰💰💰 $100    - Fix in production (user reported it)
💰💰💰💰 $1,000  - Production outage (all users affected)
💰💰💰💰💰 $10,000 - Data breach or safety incident
```

**Lesson**: Invest in earlier stages to save money and reputation.

- ❌ Error rate increases > 5%
- ❌ Response time increases > 50%
- ❌ Quality scores drop > 10%
- ❌ Customer complaints spike
- ❌ Safety violations detected
- ❌ Critical bug discovered

### Rollback Methods

#### **Method 1: Traffic Switch (Instant)**
```bash
# If using Blue-Green deployment
# Just switch traffic back to old agent
# Takes: < 1 minute

# Azure Portal or CLI:
az ai agent set-traffic --id $AGENT_ID_OLD --percentage 100
```

#### **Method 2: Agent Replacement (Fast)**
```bash
# Replace production agent with previous version
# Takes: 2-5 minutes

python scripts/rollback_to_baseline.py \
  --production-agent-id $AGENT_ID_PRODUCTION \
  --rollback-to $AGENT_ID_BASELINE
```

#### **Method 3: Re-deploy Old Code (Slow)**

## ✅ Best Practices

### Do's ✅

1. **Always test in staging first** - Never skip staging
2. **Use gradual rollouts** - Start with 10%, then 50%, then 100%
3. **Monitor intensively** - Watch metrics closely during deployment
4. **Keep rollback plan ready** - Be prepared to revert quickly
5. **Document everything** - Maintain deployment runbooks
6. **Communicate proactively** - Keep stakeholders informed
7. **Run continuous evaluations** - Quality, safety, red team tests
8. **Set up alerts** - Automated notifications for issues
9. **Maintain audit trail** - Track all changes and approvals
10. **Practice deployments** - Regular dry runs reduce risk

### Don'ts ❌

1. **Don't deploy on Fridays** - Give yourself time to fix issues
2. **Don't skip smoke tests** - Always validate after deployment
3. **Don't deploy during peak hours** - Choose low-traffic windows
4. **Don't auto-deploy to production** - Always require human approval
5. **Don't ignore small regressions** - They compound over time
6. **Don't rush deployments** - Follow the process
7. **Don't deploy without backup** - Always have rollback ready
8. **Don't ignore staging issues** - Fix them before production
9. **Don't deploy untested code** - All code must pass evaluations
10. **Don't forget monitoring** - Track metrics after deployment

### AI Agent-Specific Considerations

```yaml
Special Considerations for AI Agents:

1. Non-Deterministic Behavior:
   - Run evaluations multiple times
   - Use statistical thresholds
   - Monitor variance in responses

2. Prompt Changes:
   - Test extensively in staging
   - Small prompt changes can have big impacts
   - Always A/B test in production

3. Tool/Function Changes:
   - Verify all integrations work
   - Test error handling thoroughly
   - Monitor tool call accuracy

4. Safety is Critical:
   - Never skip safety evaluations
   - Red team testing is mandatory
   - Monitor for adversarial inputs

5. User Trust:
   - Bad AI responses damage trust quickly
   - Quality must remain consistently high
   - Transparent communication about changes
